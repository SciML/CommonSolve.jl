This holds the common `solve`, `init`, `step!`, and `solve!` commands. By using the same definition,
solver libraries from other completely different ecosystems can extend the functions and thus
not clash with SciML if both ecosystems export the `solve` command. The rules are that
you must dispatch on one of your own types. That's it. No pirates.

## General recommendation

`solve` function has the default definition

```julia
solve(args...; kwargs...) = solve!(init(args...; kwargs...))
```

So, we recommend defining

```julia
init(::ProblemType, args...; kwargs...)::SolverType
solve!(::SolverType)::SolutionType
```

where `ProblemType`, `SolverType`, and `SolutionType` are the types defined in
your package.

In many cases, the `SolverType` is an object that is iteratively progressed to achieve the solution.
In such cases, the `step!` function can be used:

```julia
step!(::SolverType, args...; kwargs...)
```

To avoid method ambiguity, the first argument of `solve`, `solve!`, `step!`, and `init`
_must_ be dispatched on the type defined in your package.  For example, do
_not_ define a method such as

```julia
init(::AbstractVector, ::AlgorithmType)
```
